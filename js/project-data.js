Continuously polls for updated connected device information: It calls the asynchronous device discovery function and updates each device based on its model.

Processes gesture results: It checks if the latest gesture (after reversing the list for priority) matches a predefined mapping for turning devices on or off.

Executes device commands: Depending on the gesture detected, it calls asynchronous functions like turn_on() or turn_off() to control the devices accordingly.
